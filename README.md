# hello-world


Houzi here, I'm just trying to add something new to my edit branch which is readme-edits.

Once done, just surprise me by the difference.
So now, let's commit changes and see what will happen!


It's so stange that my editting doesn't work at the 1st time.
So I took a 2nd try, and it finally worked!

Now it's the 3nd try - with a new branch - to see whether it will work this time.
